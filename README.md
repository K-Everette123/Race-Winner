# Race-Winner
**Race-Winner** is a program that finds the person who has ran the longest distance in a race. The distances are stored in a text file called distances.txt, and creates a new one called winner.txt to output the winner. 

This program can take either miles or kilometers, but will convert the distances to kilometers for the winner.txt file.

## Motivation
**Race-winner** was created for an assignment in the CS 230 class at Jacksonville State University.
